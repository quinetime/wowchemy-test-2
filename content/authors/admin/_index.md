Dr. Richard Dub is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Honors and advisor to the first-year Honors students.  He was born and raised in a brewery in Canada. After receiving his Masters and Ph.D. in philosophy, he spent four years in Switzerland at a center for the study of emotions before arriving at Clarkson. His area of specialization is the philosophy of mind and he has research interests in topics that include psychopathology, the emotions, and AI. He teaches Ethics and Philosophy of Science for Honors. He'll happily talk to you about these topics or about his other interests in movies or coding or games (of the board, video, or logic varieties).
